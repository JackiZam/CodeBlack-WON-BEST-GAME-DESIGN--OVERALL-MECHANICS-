# WON BEST GAME DESIGN- OVERALL MECHANICS
Contains a link to a downloadable version of the game that I worked in a team of 4 to develop for UCF's AI for Game Programming course in Fall 2024.

This build is for Windows, has an option for DEV MODE where you can select the level to start with changing up the difficulty with variable amounts available as part of the game mechanic.
More will be done for the game with my group, we have plans on adding a character selection, save files, endless mode and even a multiplayer mode.
